# Hola` 👋

## So, what do we do?

InfraCloud helps companies go from hardware to GPU Cloud. InfraCloud solutions combine the best of open source & deep infrastructure expertise to build, operate, and scale GPU Cloud. We do a few focused things in the space of infrastructure technologies - we have worked with early/mid stage startups building cloud native products with Go lang and technologies such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, Service mesh, and so on. Secondly, we work with enterprises to implement cloud native technologies. This usually spans from discovering their objectives with cloud native to actually implementing everything from CI/CD/GitOps to Service Mesh to Observability and Infra As a Code etc.

### Making Amazing Products 📦

|An open source serverless platform for Kubernetes – and enables an AWS Lambda-like easy experience for anyone new to the Kubernetes platform.| A command line interface tool designed to implement all the observability stack components (namely Prometheus and Thanos so far) is needed.

### Paying it Forward to the OSS Community 🤖
Our developers are actively leveraging and contributing to AI and Cloud OSS projects to define and shape the future of Infrastructure.
